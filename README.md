# Yoda Chatbot

This is an AI chatbot I'm creating for learning purposes, using the OpenAI API and DeepSeek API to create something cool.

My initial idea was to create a Master Yoda chatbot, but I encountered a few challenges. While the R1 model successfully mimics Yoda’s speech patterns, it appears unstable—after a few responses, the chatbot stops working altogether. For now, the system functions at a basic conceptual level, but there’s significant room for improvement. I suspect achieving a truly reliable and useful chat experience will require upgrading to a more advanced language model, such as DeepSeek or OpenAI’s offerings. At some point, I’d like to develop a visual interface for this chatbot.

That said, I enjoyed the time I spent doing this research (about 1 hour), and I hope to find a way to continue the project in the future!
