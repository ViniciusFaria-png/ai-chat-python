# Yoda Chatbot

This is an AI chatbot I'm creating for learning purposes, using the OpenAI API and DeepSeek API to create something cool.

My initial idea was to create a Master Yoda chatbot, but I ran into a few issues. The R1 documentation advises against using the system prompt, which means I can't make the chatbot talk like Yoda. Also, the OpenAI API is paid, and as a poor Brazilian, I don't have the dollars to afford it( and don't want to). So, I think this project will stay on standby until I figure something out.

That said, I enjoyed the time I spent doing this research (about 1 hour), and I hope to find a way to continue the project in the future!

## Technologies used

- OpenAI API
- DeepSeek API
- Python

## Status

Currently, the project is on standby while I figure out a viable solution.
